Hi! My name is Katon. I am pursuing a certificate in Web Programming (CSWP), together with the Associate in Applied Science in Information Technology (IT). My goal is to complete certification in CSWP and The AAS in IT for Mobile Computing. Once I've achieve the Associateâ€™s in IT, I would like to transfer my credits to a participating University, to pursue the Bachelor in Information Technology.
